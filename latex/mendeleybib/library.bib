abstract = {Present day greenhouse crop models contain many state variables. Obtaining an optimal environmental control trajectory for such crops by classical methods requires prohibitively large computational resources. In this study two shortcut methods were tried with some success: SCS, which is a simple version of model predictive control, and RMP, which is a reduced version of the Pontryagin maximum principle. The results indicate that the system may be represented for control purposes by just a fraction of the original number of state variables. In addition, the solution is relatively insensitive to future events.},

abstract = {Due to increasing competition for water resources by urban, industrial, and agricultural users, the proportion of agricultural water use is gradually decreasing. To maintain or increase agricultural production, new irrigation systems, such as surface or subsurface drip irrigation systems, will need to provide higher water use efficiency than those traditionally used. Several models have been developed to predict the dimensions of wetting patterns, which are important to design optimal drip irrigation system, using variables such as the emitter discharge, the volume of applied water, and the soil hydraulic properties. In this work, we evaluated the accuracy of several approaches used to estimate wetting zone dimensions by comparing their predictions with field and laboratory data, including the numerical HYDRUS-2D model, the analytical WetUp software, and selected empirical models. The soil hydraulic parameters for the HYDRUS-2D simulations were estimated using either Rosetta for the laboratory experiments and inverse analysis for the field experiments. The mean absolute error (MAE) was used to compare the model predictions and observations of wetting zone dimensions. MAE for different experiments and directions varied from 0.87 to 10.43 cm for HYDRUS-2D, from 1 to 58.1 cm for WetUp, and from 1.34 to 12.24 cm for other empirical models. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {A combined model for crop production and climate in greenhouses, HORTISIM, was developed. Existing models, developed by several research groups, of various aspects of crop growth and greenhouse climate have been integrated. HORTISIM contains 7 submodels (Weather, Greenhouse Climate, Soil, Crop, Greenhouse Manager, -Soil Manager and Crop Manager) plus a simulation process manager (the "Engine"). Climate conditions inside the greenhouse can be calculated from outdoor weather. The use of energy, CO2 and water can be quantified. Crop photosynthesis, dry matter production, dry matter partitioning and individual fruit growth in fruit vegetable crops can be simulated. Validation of the energy balance of a Venlo-type glasshouse with a tomato crop in The Netherlands showed that difference between simulated and measured instantaneous air temperature was mostly less than 2°C (average deviation was 0.53°C). Crop transpiration and dry matter production have been validated for Dutch and Israeli conditions. Daytime crop transpiration was simulated reasonably well, being overestimated on average by 8{\%} for tomato in The Netherlands and 1{\%} for sweet pepper in Israel. The Israeli results were quite sensitive to the choice of using mid-canopy or above-canopy temperature and VPD measurements as model input. In many situations simulated dry matter production agreed well with experimental data, although dry matter production of sweet pepper in Israeli greenhouses was overestimated by 28{\%}. Dry matter partitioning in sweet pepper was simulated rather well when simulation was based on organ sink strengths, with dates of anthesis and harvest of non-aborted fruits as model input.},

abstract = {As energy heating is one of the main production costs, many efforts have been made to reduce the energy consumption of agricultural greenhouses. Herein, a novel control method of greenhouse heating using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and energy prediction model (EPM) is proposed for energy savings and system performance. Based on the low-Reynolds number k-. $\epsilon$ turbulence principle, a CFD model of heating greenhouse is developed, applying the discrete ordinates model for the radiative heat transfers and porous medium approach for plants considering plants sensible and latent heat exchanges. The CFD simulations have been validated, and used to analyze the greenhouse thermal performance and the priority of fan coil units (FCU) loops under the various heating conditions. According to the heating efficiency and temperature uniformity, the priorities of each FCU loop can be predicted to generate a database with priorities for control system. EPM is built up based on the thermal balance, and used to predict and optimize the energy demand of the greenhouse online. Combined with the priorities of FCU loops from CFD simulations offline, we have developed the CFD-EPM-based heating control system of greenhouse with surface water source heat pumps system (SWSHPS). Compared with conventional multi-zone independent control (CMIC) method, the energy savings potential is between 8.7{\%} and 15.1{\%}, and the control temperature deviation is decreased to between 0.1. °C and 0.6. °C in the investigated greenhouse. These results show the CFD-EPM-based method can improve system performance with more accurate temperature, more rapid responses and lower energy consumption.},

abstract = {Both national and international policy responses to the rapid food price increases in 2007 and the first half of 2008 did little to address the very serious impacts on low-income urban dwellers. The speeches, declarations, plans and pledges duly noted the vulnerability of poor urban dwellers to food price rises, as they rely primarily on market purchases for their food (much more so than rural dwellers) and food purchases account for the bulk of their expenditure. Yet most policy prescriptions focused on addressing constraints to rural-based food production. This paper discusses why policy makers should pay greater attention to urban dwellers and describes the multiple pathways through which food price increases have impacts on urban people. It also highlights the evidence on how these impacts have played out during this crisis and discusses how current policy responses could be adjusted and improved to better protect the urban poor in the short and longer term. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).},

abstract = {Greenhouse farming is a growing industry in many states. It is a very expensive way to produce greenhouse crops and there are many variables to consider before the farmer decides to take this route. A good location is essential for crop planning and growing. However, current studies related to energy use patterns and resources present in vegetable production are very limited. This research attempts to investigate the energy use patterns in greenhouse vegetable production, to determine the energy output-input ratio and their relationships. Antalya province, which has greenhouse area of about 13,337 ha (30.2{\%}), is the center of greenhouse farming in Turkey. A questionnaire was distributed to 101 greenhouse farms from 11 villages in order to obtain the available data for vegetable production. Power requirement of the machines used in greenhouse operations were measured by using a computer based data acquisition system. Energy and economical variables (i.e. output-input ratio, specific energy, production cost, net return, etc.) were calculated by using the standard equations. As a result, the operational energy and energy source requirements of the greenhouse vegetable production were found between the ranges of 23,883.5-28,034.7 and 45,763.3-49,978.8 MJ/1000 m2, respectively. The energy ratio of four major greenhouse vegetables - tomato, pepper, cucumber and eggplant - was 0.32, 0.19, 0.31, 0.23, respectively. The crop yields increased as a function of the total energy inputs with the best form being second-degree polynomial. The net return of the vegetable production was found in the 595.6-2775.3 {\$}/1000 m2 ranges. Among the greenhouse vegetables, tomato cultivation resulted in being the most profitable. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most of the commercial greenhouses in the world are enveloped by Polyethylene (PE) and Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) sheets of 120 - 150 $\mu$ m in thickness instead of glass plates which are heavier and much more expensive. Plants inside these greenhouses miss about 10{\%} of sun light which can not penetrate through the PVC or PE sheets. Dust particles lying on the roof sheets scatter the light rays and prevent up to about 30{\%} of additional light energy from entering into the growth space of the greenhouse. Scratches can be formed by the dust particles rolling and moving on the plastic sheets. Because of this, the grower has losses of about 30{\%} in weight, and yield quality is lower than that of the yields from greenhouses with clean roofs. PE and PVC sheet producers add, among other additives, an additive that prevents dust from sinking on the roof sheets. Trial results have not shown a significant difference in radiation blockage between sheets with anti dust additive and those without additive. Growers need to clean the greenhouse roofs every week or two to prevent the dust from creating a layer formation that will cover the roof sheets. The cleaning is done by workers who climb to the roofs and remove the dust using brushes. The development of cleaning machinery is an urgent necessity for saving hard labor and avoiding risks to workers. The design and production of a cleaning machine works were started aiming to establish a first prototype for field trials.},

abstract = {Innovative forms of green urban architecture aim to combine food, production, and design to produce food on a larger scale in and on buildings in urban areas. It includes rooftop gardens, rooftop greenhouses, indoor farms, and other building-related forms (defined as “ZFarming”). This study uses the framework of sustainability to understand the role of ZFarming in future urban food production and to review the major benefits and limitations. The results are based on an analysis of 96 documents published in accessible international resources. The analysis shows that ZFarming has multiple functions and produces a range of non-food and non-market goods that may have positive impacts on the urban setting. It promises environmental benefits resulting from the saving and recycling of resources and reduced food miles. Social advantages include improving community food security, the provision of educational facilities, linking consumers to food production, and serving as a design inspiration. In economic terms it provides potential public benefits and commodity outputs. However, managing ZFarming faces several challenges. For some applications, the required technologies are known but have not been used or combined in that way before; others will need entirely new materials or cultivation techniques. Further critical aspects are the problem of high investment costs, exclusionary effects, and a lack of acceptance. In conclusion, ZFarming is seen as an outside-the-box solution which has some potential in generating win–win scenarios in cities. Nevertheless, ZFarming practices are not in and of themselves sustainable and need to be managed properly.},

abstract = {The glitazones or thiazolidinediones are ligands of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). The glitazones are used in the treatment of diabetes, regulate adipogenesis, inflammation, cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis in several cancer cell types. High grade astrocytomas are rapidly growing tumors derived from astrocytes, for which new treatments are needed. We determined the effects of two glitazones, ciglitazone and the therapeutic rosiglitazone, on the survival of serum-deprived primary rat astrocytes and glioma cell lines C6 and U251, which were assessed by the methylthiazolyl tetrazolium assay and lactate dehydrogenase release. Rosiglitazone (5-20 microM) decreased survival of glioma cells without affecting primary astrocytes, whereas ciglitazone at 20 microM was toxic for both cell types. Ciglitazone at 10 microM was cytoprotective for primary astrocytes but toxic to glioma cells. Cell death induced by ciglitazone, but not rosiglitazone, presented apoptotic features (Hoechst staining and externalization of phosphatidylserine). Two mechanisms to explain cytotoxicity were investigated: activation of PPARgamma and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). PPARgamma does not seem to be the main mechanism involved, because the order of efficacy for cytotoxicity, ciglitazone {\textgreater} rosiglitazone, was inverse of their reported affinities for activating PPARgamma. In addition, GW9662, an inhibitor of PPARgamma, only slightly attenuated cytotoxicity. However, the rapid increase in ROS production and the marked reduction of cell death with the antioxidants ebselen and N-acetylcysteine, indicate that ROS have a key role in glitazone cytotoxicity. Ciglitazone caused a dose-dependent and rapid loss (in minutes) of mitochondrial membrane potential in glioma cells. Therefore, mitochondria are a likely source of ROS and early targets of glitazone cytotoxicity. Our results highlight the potential of rosiglitazone and related compounds for the treatment of astrogliomas.},

However, even highly sophisticated greenhouse climate models are often known to have unknown dynamics affected by bounded uncertainties. To enforce robustness during the controller design stage, this paper proposes a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based robust MPC strategy for greenhouse temperature systems. The strategy is based on a nonlinear physical temperature affine model. The robust MPC technique requires online solution of a minimax optimal control problem, which optimizes the tradeoff between set point tracking and cost requirements reduction. The minimax optimization problem is reformulated to a nonlinear programming problem with constraints. PSO is used to solve the reformulated problem and priority ranking of constraint fitness is proposed to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied. The results of simulations performed using the proposed control system show that the controller can effectively achieve the set point in the presence of disturbances and that it offers more suitable control variables, higher control precision, and stronger robustness than the conventional MPC.},

abstract = {For decades, humans have cultivated plants in open fields and green- houses, with the aim of utilizing their primary and secondary metabolites. However, conditions in open fields and greenhouse environments are affected by weather conditions. Recently, due to research and development of plant factory with artificial lighting (PFAL), it has become possible to produce a target substance efficiently by artificially controlling environmental conditions. In this section, we introduce exam- ples of research conducted using PFALs by changing various environmental condi- tions, such as light and temperature, to increase production efficiency of useful secondary metabolites in vegetables, medicinal plants, and genetically modified plants. Various functional foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and crops, have been developed in recent years. Additionally, in PFALs, the application of various environmental conditions, such as light intensity, blue/red ratio, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and low root-zone temperature, can increase the concentrations and content of functional and medicinal compounds. Therefore, PFALs are effective for stable cultivation with accumulation of functional compounds at high concen- trations, and they can help in producing plants according to consumer needs (e.g., in terms of shape, color, and characteristics of flavors). Completely closed plant production systems (CCPPS) are considered key technologies and advanced facili- ties for the efficient and stable production of plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs) by transgenic plants. To achieve stable and high-quality production of PMPs, optimal procedures of environmental control in CCPPS should be established for each transgenic plant. Nowadays, plants are considered smart cells, which can produce several secondary metabolites, including useful materials for humans. Owing to the recent development of high-throughput gene and metabolite analysis, and bioinfor- matics technology, it is expected that these developments would facilitate rapid selection of environmental conditions suitable for controlling the concentration of target secondary metabolites.},

abstract = {In California, alfalfa is grown on a large area ranging between 325,000 and 410,000 hectares and ranks among the thirstiest crops. While the hay production industry is often scrutinized for the large usage of the state's agricultural water, alfalfa is a crucial feed-supplier for the livestock and dairy sectors, which rank among the most profitable commodity groups in the state. Sub-surface drip irrigation (SDI), although only practiced on approximately 2{\%} of the alfalfa production area in California, is claimed to have the potential to significantly increase hay yield (HY) and water productivity (WP) compared with surface irrigation (SI). In 2014-2016 we interviewed a number of growers pioneering SDI for alfalfa production in Central and Southern California who reported that yield improvements in the order of 10-30{\%} and water saving of about 20-30{\%} are achievable in SDI-irrigated fields compared with SI, according to their records and perceptions collected over few years of experience. Results from our research on SDI at the University of California, Davis, revealed significantly smaller yield gain ({\~{}}5{\%}) and a slight increase of water use ({\~{}}2-3{\%}) that are similar to findings from earlier research studies. We found that most of the interviewed alfalfa producers are generally satisfied with their SDI systems, yet face some challenges that call for additional research and educational efforts. Key limitations of SDI include high investment costs, use of energy to pressurize water, the need for more advanced irrigation management skills, and better understanding of soil-water dynamics by farm personnel. SDI-irrigated fields also need accurate water monitoring and control, attentive prevention and repair of rodent damages, and careful salinity management in the root zone. In this paper we attempt to evaluate the viability of the SDI technology for alfalfa production on the basis of preliminary results of our research and extension activities, with focus on its water and energy footprints within the context of resource efficiency.},

In outdoor cultures, sunlight provides energy (through photosynthesis) for photosynthetic organisms. They also use light quality to sense and respond to their environment. To increase the production capacity, controlled growing systems using artificial lighting have been taken into consideration. Recent development of light-emitting diode (LED) technologies presents an enor- mous potential for improving plant growth and making systems more sustainable. This review uses selected examples to show how LED can mimic natural light to ensure the growth and development of photosynthetic organisms, and how changes in intensity and wavelength can manipulate the plant metabolism with the aim to produce functionalized foods. 1. Introduction The rising population, climate changes, land use competition for food, feed, fuel and fibre production as well as the increasing demand for valuable natural compounds all reinforce the need for artificial growing systems such as green- houses, soilless systems and vertical gardening, even in spacecrafts and space stations. Most of these growing systems require the application of additional, at least supplementary, light sources to ensure plant growth. Because these sources are heat dissipaters requiring cooling, artificial systems are frequently at odds with the demand for sustainability in industrial processes. In terms of both economics and sustainability, new lighting technologies such as light- emitting diodes (LEDs) thus were necessary to be developed [1,2]. Above all technological properties, LEDs should be compatible with the photosynthesis and light-signalling requirements of plants, which are tightly linked with the two main characteristics of light: wavelength and fluence. Being mostly immobile, photosynthetic organisms must adapt to their biotic and abiotic environments that they sense through different types of receptors, including photoreceptors [3]. The pigment moiety of photoreceptors allows the receptor to extract from the incoming natural white light the specific infor- mation related to the intensity of the environmental light constraints. This information is used to develop the adequate response [3]. Photosynthesis is a photobiochemical process using light energy to produce ATP and NADPH, ultimately consumed in the assembly of carbon atoms in organic molecules. Functionally, photons are harvested by protein–chlorophyll (Chl)–carotenoid complexes (that form the light harvesting antenna of photo- systems) and then transferred to the photosystem reaction centre, where electrons are generated; these processes take place in the chloroplast [4]. If light- ing is too weak, photosynthesis cannot work efficiently and etiolation symptoms appear [5]. However, excessive light generates oxygen radicals and causes photoinhibition. Both phenomena strongly limit primary productivity [6]. Photosynthetic processes are often modified in plants grown under artificial lighting, because lamps do not usually mimic the spectrum and energy of sunlight. Agronomically, new lighting technologies such as LEDs have the potential to cover fluence and wavelength requirements of plants, while allowing specific wavelengths to be enriched, thus sup- plying the light quantity and quality essential for different phases of growth. The biomass and metabolic products of cultivated plants can therefore be modified. This review gives a brief summary of the types of artificial lighting available for growing photosynthetic organisms. The capacity of LEDs to mimic the effects of natural light in terms of energy and information, thus ensuring the growth and development of photosynthetic organisms, and the potential for manipulating the plant metabolism to produce functiona- lized foods through changes in the intensity and wavelength are also reviewed here using selected examples.},

abstract = {A subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system is potentially efficient because it provides water directly to the root zone, minimizing evaporative loss, especially in arid lands. In this study, subsurface drip irrigation was compared to standard overhead sprinkler irrigation of Bermuda grass turf using reclaimed water. Research focused on the response of Bermuda grass to two irrigation treatments, subsurface drip irrigation and overhead sprinkler irrigation. Soil moisture content was calculated via time domain reflectometry (TDR) and neutron probe data. The remotely sensed crop water stress index (CWSI) could not be used to schedule irrigation. When the average soil moisture of all eight plots was depleted to 50{\%} of readily available water, they were irrigated until the soil moisture content reached field capacity. No significant differences were observed between the two irrigation systems in total irrigation depth, relative root weight, dry clipping mass per unit area, or visual quality. The electrical conductivity (EC) of a soil water extract measured at the beginning and end of the season indicated salt accumulation near the ground surface in the subsurface plots, but there was not sufficient accumulation to affect the appearance of turf. Visual inspection of emitters after one irrigation season showed signs of root intrusion because of water stress in certain plots with high surface sand content. Keywords.

abstract = {The clogging of drippers caused by crop root intrusion has been a great concern of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems. To attempt to solve the problem of root clogging of drippers, a series of field experiments were conducted in the growing seasons of 2006-2008. The goal was to investigate the effects of Treflan injection on dripper clogging by roots, and on root distribution, yield, and the quality of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under SDI. For each growing season, two Treflan injection dates (March 6 and April 15 for the 2006-2007 growing season, and March 6 and April 15 for the 2007-2008 growing season) and three injection concentrations of 0, 3, and 7 mg/l were arranged in a randomized block experimental design. During harvest, root length density (RLD) and Treflan concentration at different soil layers were measured using the auger-sampling method. Thirty-five drippers from each treatment were randomly chosen to observe evidence of root intrusion into the dripper flow passage in order to estimate root clogging. The experimental results showed that Treflan injection could effectively reduce root density in areas adjacent to drippers, thereby significantly decreasing the potential of root clogging. In 2007, 4 out of the 35 drippers were found with root intrusion problems in the control (without Treflan injection), while no root clogging existed any dripper in Treflan application treatments. In 2008, 6 drippers from the control but only 1 dripper from those treated with Treflan application showed root clogging. In addition, within the range of concentration used by the current experiment, Treflan concentrations had no significant effects on winter wheat root distribution, yield, and quality. Injection date, however, influenced the vertical root distribution significantly. Injection of Treflan late in the growing season influenced the root distribution only in the areas close to the drippers; the influenced areas increased if Treflan was injected early in the growing season. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Contrary to the opinions expressed by many commentators, the recent episode of higher prices for agricultural commodities is likely a transitory phenomenon. When compared to the last half-century, population growth is expected to be much slower in the coming decades, with nearly all of the growth occurring in lower income countries, where added population places less pressure on global markets. The impact of the recent surge in growth rates in the developing world, and the associated dietary upgrading, will be insufficient to overcome the population effect. Further, earlier projections of biofuels growth are proving overly enthusiastic in the wake of lower oil prices and environmental concerns. Consequently, our projections using the SIMPLE model of global agriculture suggest that, in the long run, food prices are expected to be slightly lower at mid-century than they were prior to the food price crisis (2006). However, this outcome is shown to depend critically on the rate of productivity growth in agriculture. Our projections involve expected global productivity growth over the 2006-2050 period which is only 60{\%} as fast as over the historical period: 1961-2006. If total factor productivity growth slows more than this, perhaps due to adverse climate impacts or reduced investment in R{\&}D, then prices could rise in the coming decades. Also, we cannot rule out the possibility of a steeper price decline in the wake of recent signs of robust productivity growth in the developing world.},

abstract = {The extremely cold outdoor temperatures in winter continue to be a barrier for the greenhouse growers. In Saskatoon, for example, it is less than -31.5℃ for 1{\%} of the year (ASHRAE, 2013). This limits the growth of the greenhouse industry in Saskatchewan which has around 250 billion square meters of farmland, and accounts for 38.5{\%} Canada's farm area (Statistics Canada, 2016). Due to this fact, most traditional Canadian greenhouses in the Canadian Prairies shut down during the coldest months (from November to February) because of heavy heating bills. However, the local demand for food in the winter has been increasing in Saskatchewan due to a rise in population and consciousness of healthy food. If compare traditional local greenhouses with other greenhouse production techniques, Chinese mono- slope solar greenhouses do not primarily rely on supplemental heating. They rely on solar energy to maintain the indoor temperature. Fortunately, Saskatchewan has the most hours of sunshine annually in Canada which theoretically provides a favorable environment for the establishment and development of mono-slope solar greenhouses (Environment Canada, 2017). This also greatly reduces heating costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal environment and predict the energy consumption of solar greenhouse production in Saskatchewan. This was done using an existing simulation model RGWSRHJ that was developed by Chengwei Ma in China (Ma, 2015). Several modifications were made to make the model SOGREEN that is suitable for the cold climate in Saskatchewan. These modifications included meteorological year data invoking, advanced front roof covering, summer solar screen, and so on. Later, the modified simulation model SOGREEN was validated using field data that were collected in a solar greenhouse in Elie, Manitoba. Solar greenhouse production was simulated under the weather conditions in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Finally, the energy consumption was analyzed using the simulated data to select the most suitable and economical energy resource for solar greenhouse production in cold regions. From the validation results, there were 9.6{\%} and 13.7{\%} discrepancies in the model's predictions of indoor temperature and relative humidity, respectively. This has demonstrated that the modified model could simulate the thermal environment of a solar greenhouse with a ii relatively high accuracy. While the simulation results confirmed that a large amount of energy was used for supplying heat from November to March, there was almost no supplemental heat needed between April and August. This illustrated that solar greenhouses can fully utilize the solar energy, dramatically reducing the annual energy consumption. From an energy cost analysis, {\$}26378.56, {\$}2498.51 and {\$}2610.00 was spent for supplemental heat with electricity, natural gas, and coal. Therefore, among these three energy resources, natural gas was the most affordable and most environmentally friendly option for greenhouse production. Compared with the natural gas expenses of Grandora Gardens, vegetable production in a solar greenhouse can save as much as 83.6{\%} in energy costs. This demonstrates that solar greenhouse production in Saskatchewan is in fact economical for the Canadian Prairies.},

A special procedure was applied to find optimum values of the following endogenous (decision) variables: the depth and span of heating elements in the soil substratum, as well as the temperature of the medium fed into the system (for the buried pipe system) and the fed-in water temperature and span between heating elements (for the vegetation heating system). The heat losses were studied, temperature differences in the soil space observed, and the required heating efficiency of pipes defined. The basic analysis shows that for similar substrate temperature conditions, the vegetation heating system requires 3 K higher water temperature than does the buried pipe system, and heat loss is higher for the vegetation system. The uneven temperature distribution in the substratum and heat losses were defined for the optimum values of decision variables in both systems. {\textcopyright} 2000 Silsoe Research Institute.},

abstract = {Solar energy is a major renewable energy source and hybrid solar systems are gaining increased academic and industrial attention due to the unique advantages they offer. In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed to investigate the thermal behavior of a greenhouse heated by a hybrid solar collector system. This hybrid system contains an evacuated tube solar heat collector unit, an auxiliary fossil fuel heating unit, a hot water storage unit, control and piping units. A Matlab/Simulink based model and software has been developed to predict the storage water temperature, greenhouse indoor temperature and the amount of auxiliary fuel, as a function of various design parameters of the greenhouse such as location, dimensions, and meteorological data of the region. As a case study, a greenhouse located in ŞanlIurfa/Turkey has been simulated based on recent meteorological data and aforementioned hybrid system. The results of simulations performed on an annual basis indicate that revising the existing fossil fuel system with the proposed hybrid system, is economically feasible for most cases, however it requires a slightly longer payback period than expected. On the other hand, by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions significantly, it has a considerable positive environmental impact. The developed dynamic simulation method can be further used for designing heating systems for various solar greenhouses and optimizing the solar collector and thermal storage sizes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Supplemental lighting in greenhouses is often needed for year-round production of high-quality crops. However, the electricity needed for supplemental lighting can account for a substantial part of overall production costs. Our objective was to develop more efficient control methods for supplemental lighting, taking advantage of the dimmability of light-emitting diode (LED) grow lights. We compared 14 hours per day of full power supplemental LED lighting to two other treatments: 1) turning the LEDs on, at full power, only when the ambient photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) dropped below a specific threshold, and 2) adjusting the duty cycle of the LEDs so that the LED lights provided only enough supplemental PPF to reach a preset threshold PPF. This threshold PPF was adjusted daily from 50 to 250 µmol{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}s-1. Turning the LED lights on at full power and off based on a PPF threshold was not practical since this at times resulted in the lights going on and off frequently. Adjusting the duty cycle of the LED lights based on PPF measurements underneath the light bar provided excellent control of PPF, with 5-minute averages typically being within 0.2 µmol{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}s-1 of the threshold PPF. Continuously adjusting the duty cycle of the LED lights reduced electricity use by 20{\%} to 92{\%}, depending on the PPF threshold and daily light integral (DLI) from sunlight. Simulations based on net photosynthesis (An)LPPF response curves indicated that there are large differences among species in how efficiently supplemental PPF stimulates An. When there is little or no sunlight, An of Heuchera americana is expected to increase more than that of Campanula portenschlagiana when a low level of supplemental light is provided. Conversely, when ambient PPF {\textgreater}200 µmol{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}s-1, supplemental lighting will have little impact on An of H. americana, but can still results in significant increases in An of C. portenschlagiana (1.7 to 6.1 µmol{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}s-1 as supplemental PPF increases from 50 to 250 µmol{\textperiodcentered}m-2{\textperiodcentered}s-1). Adjusting the duty cycle of the LEDs based on PPF levels assures that supplemental light is provided when plants can use that supplemental light most efficiently. Implementing automated duty cycle control of LED grow lights is simple and low cost. This approach can increase the cost effectiveness of supplemental lighting, because of the associated energy savings.},

abstract = {In this study, a comprehensive review focusing on key strategies of energy saving and climate control technologies for greenhouses is presented. Following the brief and concise assessment of existing greenhouse systems in terms of their role in total energy consumption; cost-effective, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly technologies are analyzed in detail for potential utilization in greenhouses for notable reductions in energy consumption and emission levels. The technologies considered within the scope of this research are mainly renewable and sustainable based solutions such as photovoltaic (PV) modules, solar thermal (T) collectors, hybrid PV/T collectors and systems, phase change material (PCM) and underground based heat storage techniques, energy-efficient heat pumps, alternative facade materials for better thermal insulation and power generation (heat insulation solar glass, PV glazing, aerogel and vacuum insulation panel, polycarbonate sandwich panels), innovative ventilation technologies using pre-heating and cooling (high performance windcatchers) and efficient lighting systems. The findings from the research clearly reveal that up to 80{\%} energy saving can be achieved through appropriate retrofit of conventional greenhouses with a payback period of 4-8 years depending on climatic conditions and crop type.},

@article{Hasni2011,
abstract = {In the world, the greenhouse culture is getting more and more developed to meet the needs of a more competitive market that is conditioned by very strict norms of quality. Greenhouse production systems are getting highly sophisticated but extremely expensive. That is the reason why the greenhousers, who want to be competitive must optimize their investments thanks to strict production conditions. Nowadays, it is commonly admitted that the decisions related to the management of a greenhouse can be classified into different levels, starting from the on-line control, through the optimization of the environment, to the seasonal planning of the behaviour of the agriculture. The main purpose of our work is to optimize the physical sizes of a reduced model of a greenhouse under Mediterranean conditions. Thus, we use a digital simulation based genetic algorithm (GA) and a particle swarm optimization (PSO). The design goal is successfully achieved using the PSO and compared with that obtained using the GA. For the problem at hand, it is found that the PSO outperforms the GA in some of the presented design cases. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel hierarchical control approach and new mathematical optimization models of greenhouses, which can be readily incorporated into energy hub management systems (EHMSs) in the context of smart grids to optimize the operation of their energy systems. In greenhouses, artificial lighting, CO2 production, and climate control systems consume considerable energy; thus, a mathematical model of greenhouses appropriate for their optimal operation is proposed, so that it can be implemented as a supervisory control in existing greenhouse control systems. The objective is to minimize total energy costs and demand charges while considering important parameters of greenhouses; in particular, inside temperature and humidity, CO2 concentration, and lighting levels should be kept within acceptable ranges. Therefore, the proposed model incorporates weather forecasts, electricity price information, and the end-user preferences to optimally operate existing control systems in greenhouses. Effects of uncertainty in electricity price and weather forecast on optimal operation of the storage facilities are studied through Monte Carlo simulations. The presented simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model to reduce total energy costs while maintaining required operational constraints.},

@article{Kazumba2010,
abstract = {Scarcity of fresh high-quality water has heightened the importance of wastewater reuse primarily in dry regions together with improving its efficient use by implementing the Subsurface Drip Irrigation (SDI) method. Sustainable effluent reuse combines soil and plant aspects, along with the maintainability of the application system. In this study, field experiments were conducted for two years on the commercial farm of Revivim and Mashabay-Sade farm (RMF) southeast of the City of Beer-Sheva, Israel. The purpose was to examine the response of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) as a perennial model crop to secondary domestic effluent application by means of a SDI system as compared with conventional overhead sprinkler irrigation. Emitters were installed at different depths and spacing. Similar amounts of effluent were applied to all plots during the experimental period. The results indicated that in all SDI treatments, the alfalfa yields were 11{\%} to 25{\%} higher than the ones obtained under sprinkler irrigated plots, besides the one in which the drip laterals were 200cm apart. The average Water Use Efficiency (WUE) was better in all SDI treatments in comparison with the sprinkler irrigated plots. An economic assessment reveals the dependence of the net profit on the emitters' installation geometry, combined with the return for alfalfa in the market. {\textcopyright} IWA Publishing 2010.},
